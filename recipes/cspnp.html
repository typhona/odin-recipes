  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Browned Italian sausage and chicken thighs with sweet peppers, red onions, and Yukon Gold potatoes are doused in olive oil and tossed with dried herbs before hitting a very hot oven. Chef John says, "You'll need a large, heavy-duty roasting pan
    (or a couple of smaller ones) and a very hot oven for this delicious dish. The long oven time makes everything beautifully caramelized and the chicken fork tender." Meanwhile, ccok4fun raves about it: "This recipe is amazing! I highly recommend
    watching the video. Next time I'll use more veggies & potatoes because they are just delicious!"</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul class="ingredients_list">
    <li class="ingredients_list_item">4 large links hot Italian sausage</li>
    <li class="ingredients_list_item">2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li class="ingredients_list_item">6 bone-in, skin on chicken thighs</li>
    <li class="ingredients_list_item">½ pound assorted sweet peppers, seeded</li>
    <li class="ingredients_list_item">1 small red onion, sliced</li>
    <li class="ingredients_list_item">½ yellow onion, sliced</li>
    <li class="ingredients_list_item">4 large Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered</li>
    <li class="ingredients_list_item">2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs</li>
    <li class="ingredients_list_item">2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
    <li class="ingredients_list_item">Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li class="ingredients_list_item">1 tablespoon Chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol class="steps_list">
    <li class="steps_list_item">Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>

    <li class="steps_list_item">Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook sausage links until browned and oil begins to render, about 3 minutes per side. While sausages are cooking, pierce them lightly here and there with the tip of a sharp
      knife so some fats and
      juices are released. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.</li>

    <li class="steps_list_item">When sausages are cool enough to handle, cut them into serving pieces, about 2-inch slices. Transfer back to pan along with any accumulated juices from the cutting board.</li>

    <li class="steps_list_item">Cut two slashes down to the bone on the skin side of each chicken thigh.</li>

    <li class="steps_list_item">Depending on the size of the peppers, halve or quarter them and place in a large mixing bowl. Add the sliced red and yellow onions and potato chunks. Add chicken thighs and sausage pieces with pan juices.</li>

    <li class="steps_list_item">Season with kosher salt, black pepper, and Italian herbs. Drizzle with a tablespoon of olive oil.</li>

    <li class="steps_list_item">Mix with your hands until all ingredients are coated in oil, 3 or 4 minutes. Transfer to large, heavy-duty roasting pan. Evenly space the chicken thighs skin side up. Position potatoes near the top.</li>

    <li class="steps_list_item">Place in preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and everything is caramelized, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with chopped
      fresh Italian parsley, if
      desired.</li>
  </ol>
